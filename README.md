JAVA OOP NOTES

An Introduction to Object

Orientated Programming
Introduction
This chapter will discuss different programming paradigms and the advantages of the Object Oriented
approach to software development and modelling. The concepts on which object orientation depend
(abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism) will be explained.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will be able to...
• Explain what Object Oriented Programming is,
• Describe the benefits of the Object Oriented programming approach and
• Understand and the basic concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, generalisation and
polymorphism on which object oriented programming relies.
All of these issues will be explored in much more detail in later chapters of this book.
This chapter consists of six sections:-
1) A Brief History of Computing
2) Different Programming Paradigms
3) Why use the Object Oriented Paradigm
4) Object Oriented Principles
5) What Exactly is Object Oriented Programming?
6) The Benefits of the Object Oriented Programming Approach.
1.1 A Brief History of Computing
Computing is a constantly changing our world and our environment. In the 1960s large machines called
mainframes were created to manage large volumes of data (numbers) efficiently. Bank account and payroll
programs changed the way organisations worked and made parts of these organisations much more efficient.
In the 1980s personal computers became common and changed the way many individuals worked. People
started to own their own computers and many used word processors and spreadsheets applications (to
write letters and to manage home accounts). In the 1990s email became common and the world wide web
was born. These technologies revolutionised communications allowing individuals to publish information
that could easily be accessed on a global scale. The ramifications of these new technologies are still not
fully understood as society is adapting to opportunities of internet commerce, new social networking
technologies (twitter, facebook, myspace, online gaming etc) and the challenges of internet related crime.


The Object Oriented paradigm builds upon and extends the ideas behind the structured programming
paradigm of the 1970s.

1.3 Why use the Object Orientation Paradigm?
While we can focus our attention on the actual program code we are writing, whatever development
methodology is adopted, it is not the creation of the code that is generally the source of most problems.
Most problems arise from:-
• poor analysis and design: the computer system we create doesn’t do the right thing.
• poor maintainability: the system is hard to understand and revise when, as is inevitable,
requests for change arise.
Statistics show 70% of the cost of software is not incurred during its initial development phase but is
incurred during subsequent years as the software is amended to meet the ever changing needs of the
organisation for which it was developed. For this reason it is essential that software engineers to everything
possible to ensure that software is easy to maintain during the years after its initial creation.

The Object Oriented programming paradigm aims to help overcome these problems by helping with the
analysis and design tasks during the initial software development phase (see chapter 6 for more details
on this) and by ensuring software is robust and maintainable (see chapters 9–11 for information on the
support Object Orientation and Java provides).
1.4 Object Oriented Principles
Abstraction and encapsulation are fundamental principles that underlie the Object Oriented approach to
software development. Abstraction allows us to consider complex ideas while ignoring irrelevant detail
that would confuse us. Encapsulation allows us to focus on what something does without considering
the complexities of how it works.
Activity 3
Consider your home and imagine you were going to swap your home for a week with a
new friend.
Write down three essential things you would tell them about your home and that you would
want to know about their home.
Now list three irrelevant details that you would not tell your friend.

The Benefits of the Object Oriented Programming Approach
Whether or not you develop programs in an object oriented way, before you write the software you must
first develop a model of what that software must be able to do and how it should work. Object oriented
modelling is based on the ideas of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
The general proponents of the object oriented approach claims that this model provides:
• better abstractions (modelling information and behaviour together)
• better maintainability (more comprehensible, less fragile)
• better reusability (classes as encapsulated components)
We will return to look at these claims later in Chapter 11 as we see a case study showing in detail how
object oriented analysis works and how the resultant models can be implemented in an object oriented
programming language (i.e. Java).
1.7 Summary
Object oriented programming involves the creation of classes by modelling the real world. This allows
more specialised classes to be created that inherit the behaviour of the generalised classes. Polymorphic
behaviour means that systems can be changed, as business needs change, by adding new specialised
classes and these classes can be accessed by the rest of the system without any regard to their specialised
behaviour and without changing other parts of the current system.
